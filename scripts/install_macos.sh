#!/usr/bin/env bash
# install_macos.sh — one-click macOS installer for OpenLab Recorder.
#
# Called by INSTALL_macOS.command at the repo root. Can also be run directly:
#     bash scripts/install_macos.sh
#
# Why each step exists:
#
#   1. Homebrew — macOS has no built-in package manager. brew is the de facto
#      standard for installing python@3.12 and liblsl. Apple Silicon installs
#      to /opt/homebrew, Intel to /usr/local — handled below.
#
#   2. Python 3.12 — modern macOS ships /usr/bin/python3 only after Xcode
#      Command Line Tools is installed (and it's older). brew install
#      python@3.12 is the reliable path. Pinned to 3.12 because brainflow's
#      wheel coverage for 3.13 may lag on macOS arm64.
#
#   3. liblsl — pylsl on macOS is the silent failure: `pip install pylsl`
#      succeeds, but `import pylsl` throws because liblsl.dylib isn't found.
#      The labstreaminglayer org's brew tap (labstreaminglayer/tap/lsl) is
#      the standard install path. UNVERIFIED against the live brew tap
#      this session — if `brew install labstreaminglayer/tap/lsl` fails,
#      falls back to suggesting the conda-forge path.
#
#   4. install.py — pip deps + LabRecorder download (existing repo script).
#
#   5. Gatekeeper quarantine strip — macOS quarantines any file downloaded
#      from a browser / curl / urlretrieve with the com.apple.quarantine
#      extended attribute. Trying to launch the LabRecorder binary then
#      triggers "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified."
#      `xattr -d -r com.apple.quarantine <path>` removes the attribute.
#      This is the canonical Gatekeeper bypass for user-trusted downloads.
#
#   6. Desktop alias — macOS equivalent of the Windows .lnk shortcut.
#      Uses osascript to make a Finder alias since `ln -s` puts a unix
#      symlink that Finder treats oddly.
